## ╰┈➤ 𝓐𝓫𝓸𝓾𝓽 𝓜𝓮
I'm a passionate developer focused on combining software and electronics to solve real-world problems. I actively develop projects using languages such as Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript, with a particular interest in artificial intelligence, computer vision, voice assistant systems, and embedded systems.

### 🛠️ Areas I focus on:
YOLO-based object detection systems
Real-time computer vision on Jetson Nano
Voice assistant and natural language processing applications with Python
Autonomous software for RC aircraft and UAV systems
Simple UI designs and automation tools (e.g. WhatsApp bots, voice command systems)
I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and sharing what I learn with the community. I regularly document my work on GitHub and share my experiences through platforms like YouTube and Instagram.

#### 📌 Currently, I'm working on a voice assistant that understands Turkish and can control desktop applications using voice commands. I'm also developing autonomous systems and UAV projects for competitions like TEKNOFEST.

💡 My goal is to create sustainable, smart solutions by merging software with hardware. I see every project as a learning opportunity and strive to stay open to growth and innovation.
